# SMART COMPUTER

OVERVIEW:

Once the computer is up and running- 
1. We can browse through all the apps and select the app we need,

2. If a browser page is open,we can scroll up and down the page, 

3. If a video player is up and running we can play and pause the video,even fast forwarding and rewinding would be possible. 
And all of these could be done with mere hand gestures.
